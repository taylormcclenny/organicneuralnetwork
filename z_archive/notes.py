PATHWAY:
photon -> 
    -> rod/cone -> 
        -> bipolar cell (rod-bp / cone-bp) -> 
        - horizontal cell (spread signal pre-bipolar)
        - amacrine (spread signal post-bipolar)
            -> ganglion ->
                -> optic nerve
    
NOTES:
- Learning
    - "Some receptors set off a signal cascade when activated, and lead to the transcription of new proteins or 
        the insertion of more receptors into the cell membrane"
    - "Synaptic signaling, on the other hand, is much more flexible. For instance, a sending neuron can "dial up" 
        or "dial down" the amount of neurotransmitter it releases in response to the arrival of an action potential. 
        Similarly, a receiving cell can alter the number of receptors it puts on its membrane and how readily it 
        responds to activation of those receptors. These changes can strengthen or weaken communication at a 
        particular synapse."

- Rods & Cones
    - "Rods and cones hyperpolarize in response to light, and there is no sign of action potentials in them. It 
        turns out that the synapses of rods and cones release neurotransmitter, in just the same way as any other 
        cell. When the cell hyperpolarizes, less neurotransmitter is released by their synapses.  Why do they not 
        make action potentials? The reason is that rods and cones are very tiny cells. A garden variety neuron of 
        the brain – say a cortical pyramidal cell – might extend for around 2 millimeters. A rod or cone spans 
        only 20-30 microns from tip to base. Since the rod does not have to transmit information very far, there 
        is no need for action potentials. The electrotonic decrement between the end of the outer segment and the 
        base of the synapse is so small, that no regenerative activity is required."
    
    "The same is true for retinal bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and many amacrine cells, which are equally 
        tiny. The cells of the outer retina do not need to make action potentials, because electrotonic decrements 
        are very small. In contrast, the retinal ganglion cell must send an axon several centimeters to the brain.  
        There, action potentials are required."

- Horizontal Cells
    - "Lateral inhibition occurring in the retina sharpens the difference between two nearby stimuli."
    - "As we have just seen, there is a partitioning of information into two distinct pathways at the synapse between photoreceptors and bipolar cells.  At the same level, a second computation occurs: lateral inhibition sharpens the contrast between neighboring regions of illumination."
    - "Notice that the lateral extent of the horizontal cell is much greater than the size of the individual rods, cones, or bipolar cells.  An individual rod or cone outer segment is around 2 μm in diameter.  A horizontal cell may be 500 μm."
    - "Because the neurotransmitter of horizontal cells is inhibitory, because the horizontal cell feeds back onto the rods and cones, and because the horizontal cell has a wide spatial extent, this cell can spatially sharpen the response of retinal ganglion cells to small stimuli.  In effect, when a small stimulus falls on the retina, regions around it are inhibited by the horizontal cell.  One way to think of this is that the horizontal cell creates a region of “hyper-darkness” around a small stimulus.  Light falling on a small patch of retina causes hyperpolarization of the rods and/or cones directly stimulated by the light.  In neighboring regions, though, negative feedback from the horizontal cells causes the rods and/or cones to be depolarized.  To understand the sign of these changes, one must slowly walk through a long series of sign reversals.  This is clearly diagrammed in the chapter on the retina by Kandel, Schwartz and Jessell."
    - "The effect of this for information processing in the retina is that regions of change between light and darkness are accentuated.  When light falls on a patch of retina there is a region of excitation surrounded by a trough of inhibition.  In the absence of lateral inhibition, two neighboring stimuli tend to blend into one.  A central “detector”, located in the brain must discriminate a narrow trough of excitation.  Lateral inhibition occurring in the retina sharpens the difference between two nearby stimuli."

- Bipolar Cells
    - Midget cone bipolar cells synapse directly with midget ganglion cells
    - Diffuse cone bipolar cells (up to 7 cones, to many ganglion)
    - "Cone bipolar cells are used during rod vision, revealing that the rod and cone circuits are intertwined."
    - "Unlike most neurons, bipolar cells communicate via graded potentials, rather than action potentials."
    - "the potential at any point in a cell's membrane is determined by the ion concentration differences between 
        the intracellular and extracellular areas, and by the permeability of the membrane to each type of ion."
    - "The change in membrane potential can be either large or small, depending on how many ion channels are 
        activated and what type they are, and can be either long or short, depending on the lengths of time that 
        the channels remain open. Changes of this type are referred to as graded potentials, in contrast to action 
        potentials, which have a fixed amplitude and time course."
    - "Graded membrane potentials are particularly important in neurons, where they are produced by synapses—a 
        temporary change in membrane potential produced by activation of a synapse by a single graded or action 
        potential is called a postsynaptic potential. Neurotransmitters that act to open Na+ channels typically 
        cause the membrane potential to become more positive, while neurotransmitters that activate K+ channels 
        typically cause it to become more negative; those that inhibit these channels tend to have the opposite 
        effect."
    - "Whether a postsynaptic potential is considered excitatory or inhibitory depends on the reversal potential 
        for the ions of that current, and the threshold for the cell to fire an action potential (around –50mV). A 
        postsynaptic current with a reversal potential above threshold, such as a typical Na+ current, is considered 
        excitatory. A current with a reversal potential below threshold, such as a typical K+ current, is considered 
        inhibitory. A current with a reversal potential above the resting potential, but below threshold, will not by 
        itself elicit action potentials, but will produce subthreshold membrane potential oscillations. Thus, 
        neurotransmitters that act to open Na+ channels produce excitatory postsynaptic potentials, or EPSPs, whereas 
        neurotransmitters that act to open K+ or Cl− channels typically produce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, 
        or IPSPs. When multiple types of channels are open within the same time period, their postsynaptic potentials 
        summate (are added together)."

- Amacrine Cells
    - "A second form of signal processing occurs deeper in the retina.  It is mediated by amacrine cells.  The net result of the processing is that the responses of some retinal ganglion cells become phasic, which means that the cells are sensitive primarily to changes in illumination rather than simply its ongoing level."
    - "The effect is that a train of action potentials is generated by the ganglion cell immediately after the onset of the stimulus, but it is soon reduced by the amacrine cell feedback onto the bipolar cell.  These ganglion cells are thus phasically active, firing a burst of action potentials immediately after the onset of a stimulus but fewer as the stimulus continues."
    
- Ganglion Cells
    - Midget ganglion cells, synapse w/ only 1 bipolar cell (part of cone visual pathway only)
    - Diffuse ganglion cells, synapse w/ several bipolar cells
    - "The ganglion cell receives information from all stages in the visual pathway. The ganglion cell can
        convey signals that drive the circadian and pupillomotor systems by combining the rod and cone 
        photoresponses, as well as its own photoresponses."
    - Opposing Responses of Center and Periphery Receptive Fields:
        "Another effect of this inhibitory organization is to prevent unneeded information from reaching the
        brain. There are about one million optic nevre fibers, and if all of them were discharging information
        at once, the brain would have too many messages to decode. This mechanism helps to cut down the amount
        of information the brain needs to process."
    - "Another method that some ganglion cells use to decrease the amount of action potentials it sends to the
        optic nerve is to respond to light moving only in a specific direction. When an object moves in the
        ganglion's preferred direcetion an excitatory impulse occurs. When the object moves in the opposite
        direction, however, both excitatory and inhibitory impulses occur, effectively canceling each other out."

- Amacrine Cells
    "This impluse activity is important, as it performs feedforward inhibition on ganglion 
    cells and feedback inhibition on bipolar cells via action potentials. The amacrine cells exerts a
    restraining influence on certain junctions of the retina, reducing the spread of messages. In relation
    to the ganglion dendritic tree, bipolar cells make up the center of the receptive field, while amacrine
    cells make up the periphery. When the amacrine cells exert an inhibitory action, the bipolar cells in
    the central zone of the field are prevented from respoding to the receptors, and the message is not
    sent to the ganglion cell. The inhibition caused by the amacrine cell has two distninct modes, local
    and global. If the action potential can not be propgated down the cell to the dendrites then they provide
    local inhibiion. If, however, the action potential invades the entire denritic tree, it provides global 
    inhibition."

- Conclusion
    "At first glance the reason for the retina's interbranching visual pathway is hard to understand. But, after
    putting together the functions of each type of retinal nerve cell, one sees that each cell is essential.
    The complexity of the pathway serves to clarify the message coming into the eye, and to prevent unnecessary
    information from being transmitted to the brain."


OCCIPITAL LOBE:
- Primary Visual Cortex
    - "The first functional area is the primary visual cortex. It contains a low-level description of the local 
        orientation, spatial-frequency and color properties within small receptive fields. Primary visual cortex 
        projects to the occipital areas of the ventral stream (visual area V2 and visual area V4), and the occipital 
        areas of the dorsal stream—visual area V3, visual area MT (V5), and the dorsomedial area (DM).
        The ventral stream is known for the processing the "what" in vision, while the dorsal stream handles the 
        "where/how." This is because the ventral stream provides important information for the identification of 
        stimuli that are stored in memory. With this information in memory, the dorsal stream is able to focus on 
        motor actions in response to the outside stimuli."
    - "Retinal sensors convey stimuli through the optic tracts to the lateral geniculate bodies, where optic 
        radiations continue to the visual cortex. Each visual cortex receives raw sensory information from the 
        outside half of the retina on the same side of the head and from the inside half of the retina on the other 
        side of the head. The cuneus (Brodmann's area 17) receives visual information from the contralateral superior 
        retina representing the inferior visual field. The lingula receives information from the contralateral 
        inferior retina representing the superior visual field. The retinal inputs pass through a "way station" in 
        the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus before projecting to the cortex. Cells on the posterior aspect 
        of the occipital lobes' gray matter are arranged as a spatial map of the retinal field. Functional neuroimaging 
        reveals similar patterns of response in cortical tissue of the lobes when the retinal fields are exposed to a 
        strong pattern."

- Receptive Field
    - "The receptive field is often identified as the region of the retina where the action of light alters the 
        firing of the neuron."

    - "Hubel and Wiesel advanced the theory that receptive fields of cells at one level of the visual system 
        are formed from input by cells at a lower level of the visual system. In this way, small, simple receptive 
        fields could be combined to form large, complex receptive fields. Later theorists elaborated this simple, 
        hierarchical arrangement by allowing cells at one level of the visual system to be influenced by feedback 
        from higher levels."

    - "The receptive field, or sensory space, is a delimited medium where some physiological stimuli can evoke a 
        sensory neuronal response in specific organisms.
        Complexity of the receptive field ranges from the unidimensional chemical structure of odorants to the 
        multidimensional spacetime of human visual field, through the bidimensional skin surface, being a receptive 
        field for touch perception. Receptive fields can positively or negatively alter the membrane potential with 
        or without affecting the rate of action potentials.
        A sensory space can be dependent of an animal's location. For a particular sound wave traveling in an 
        appropriate transmission medium, by means of sound localization, an auditory space would amount to a 
        reference system that continuously shifts as the animal moves (taking into consideration the space inside 
        the ears as well). Conversely, receptive fields can be largely independent of the animal's location, as in 
        the case of place cells. A sensory space can also map into a particular region on an animal's body. For 
        example, it could be a hair in the cochlea or a piece of skin, retina, or tongue or other part of an animal's 
        body. Receptive fields have been identified for neurons of the auditory system, the somatosensory system, 
        and the visual system.
        This concept of receptive fields can be extended further up the nervous system. If many sensory receptors 
        all form synapses with a single cell further up, they collectively form the receptive field of that cell. 
        For example, the receptive field of a ganglion cell in the retina of the eye is composed of input from all 
        of the photoreceptors which synapse with it, and a group of ganglion cells in turn forms the receptive field 
        for a cell in the brain. This process is called convergence.
        Receptive fields have been used in modern artificial deep neural networks that work with local operations."

    Visual System
        - "In the visual system, receptive fields are volumes in visual space."
        Visual Space
            "Visual space is the experience of space by an aware observer. It is the subjective counterpart of 
            the space of physical objects."
    
    Retinal ganglion cells
        - "The organization of ganglion cells' receptive fields, composed of inputs from many rods and cones, 
            provides a way of detecting contrast, and is used for detecting objects' edges. Each receptive field
            is arranged into a central disk, the "center", and a concentric ring, the "surround", each region 
            responding oppositely to light. For example, light in the centre might increase the firing of a 
            particular ganglion cell, whereas light in the surround would decrease the firing of that cell."
        - "The center-surround receptive field organization allows ganglion cells to transmit information not 
            merely about whether photoreceptor cells are exposed to light, but also about the differences in 
            firing rates of cells in the center and surround. This allows them to transmit information about 
            contrast. The size of the receptive field governs the spatial frequency of the information: small 
            receptive fields are stimulated by high spatial frequencies, fine detail; large receptive fields are 
            stimulated by low spatial frequencies, coarse detail. Retinal ganglion cell receptive fields convey 
            information about discontinuities in the distribution of light falling on the retina; these often 
            specify the edges of objects. In dark adaptation, the peripheral opposite activity zone becomes 
            inactive, but, since it is a diminishing of inhibition between center and periphery, the active field 
            can actually increase, allowing more area for summation."
