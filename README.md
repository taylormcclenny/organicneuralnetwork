# organicneuralnetwork
Advancements in NN are getting increasingly contrived. My ONN ("Organic Neural Network") is a return to first principles, building a new NN architecture from foundational Neuroscience principles - AND NO GRADIENT DESCENT.

DISCLAIMER:  This is an ongoing and rapidly developing project. The majority of my time is spent researching Neuroscience (the various neuron layers of the eye, the ocular nerve, the occipital lobe, their feedback, and the first principles that drive them) and experimenting. As such, I am currently spending little time optimizing this code. Everything is currently focused on R&D and gaining observable, first principle understanding.
